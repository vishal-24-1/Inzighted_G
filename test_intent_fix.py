Quick test for intent classification fix
Run after server is started to verify the RETURN_QUESTION flow
"""

# Example of what should happen now:

# Test 1: User asks clarifying question
"""
User: "what is chunker?"

Expected Flow:
1. Intent Classifier: RETURN_QUESTION
2. RAG retrieves answer from document about chunker
3. Response: "Chunker worker enna pannum nu un friend-kku solra maari sollu. 
             (Chunks = small pieces). Now, let's continue with the question."
4. Same question re-asked
5. No evaluation (since user asked, didn't answer)
"""

# Test 2: User provides answer with question
"""
User: "Chunker breaks documents into pieces, but what does hallucination rate mean?"

Expected Flow:
1. Intent Classifier: MIXED
2. Evaluate: "Chunker breaks documents into pieces" → score, XP
3. RAG answers: "Hallucination rate 5% ah meering enna aagum?"
4. Next question in queue
5. Returns both evaluation and clarification
"""

# Test 3: User provides direct answer
"""
User: "Chunker worker is used for processing document chunks"

Expected Flow:
1. Intent Classifier: DIRECT_ANSWER
2. Evaluate answer → score, XP, Tanglish feedback
3. Next question in queue
4. No clarification needed
