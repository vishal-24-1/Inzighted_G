# Existing Endpoints Upgraded to Tanglish Agent

## Summary

The existing tutoring endpoints have been **upgraded** to use the new Tanglish Agent flow internally, while maintaining the same API contract. Your frontend doesn't need any changes!

## What Changed

### Before (Old Flow)
```
POST /api/tutoring/start/
  → Simple question generation
  → No intent classification
  → No answer evaluation
  → No XP tracking
  → No Tanglish style enforcement

POST /api/tutoring/{id}/answer/
  → Just save answer
  → Generate next question
  → No feedback or scoring
```

### After (New Tanglish Agent Flow)
```
POST /api/tutoring/start/
  ✅ Structured question generation with 10 questions
  ✅ Tanglish style prompts
  ✅ 7 archetypes (Concept Unfold, Critical Reversal, etc.)
  ✅ Difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
  ✅ Expected answers tracked

POST /api/tutoring/{id}/answer/
  ✅ Intent classification (DIRECT_ANSWER/MIXED/RETURN_QUESTION)
  ✅ Answer evaluation with score (0.0-1.0)
  ✅ XP points awarded (1-100)
  ✅ Tanglish feedback/explanation
  ✅ Smart branching based on intent
  ✅ Insights generation after completion
```

## New Response Fields

### Start Session Response (UNCHANGED structure, enhanced data)
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "first_question": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "text": "Tanglish question with archetype...",
    "created_at": "2025-10-06T..."
  }
}
```

### Answer Response (ENHANCED with new fields)
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "response_time_ms": 1250,
  
  // NEW: Feedback when agent responds to user question
  "feedback": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "text": "Good question! Let me clarify..."
  },
  
  // Next question (existing field)
  "next_question": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "text": "Next Tanglish question...",
    "created_at": "2025-10-06T..."
  },
  
  // NEW: Evaluation results with XP and scoring
  "evaluation": {
    "score": 0.85,
    "xp": 75,
    "correct": true,
    "explanation": "Perfect understanding! Current-um voltage-um same phase la...",
    "followup_action": "none"
  },
  
  // Session completion (existing)
  "finished": false,
  "message": "..."
}
```

## Frontend Compatibility

✅ **100% Backward Compatible**
- Same endpoint URLs
- Same request format
- Response structure preserved
- Additional fields are optional (frontend can ignore them)

## Features Now Active

1. **Tanglish Questions** - All questions use Tanglish style prompts
2. **Intent Classification** - User messages classified as answer/question/mixed
3. **Answer Evaluation** - Real-time scoring with XP (1-100 points)
4. **Smart Feedback** - Tanglish explanations for answers
5. **Structured Questions** - 7 archetypes, difficulty levels, expected answers
6. **Session Insights** - SWOT analysis generated after completion

## Testing

Start a new tutoring session and you'll immediately see:

1. **First Question** - Will be in Tanglish style from structured batch
2. **When you answer** - You'll get:
   - XP points in `evaluation.xp`
   - Score in `evaluation.score`
   - Tanglish explanation in `evaluation.explanation`
3. **If you ask a question** - Agent will detect it and provide clarification
4. **After completion** - Insights will be generated automatically

## Logs to Watch

```
Calling Gemini LLM for batch generation of 10 questions...
Successfully generated 10 structured questions
Intent classified as: DIRECT_ANSWER
Answer evaluated: score=0.85, XP=75
Session insights generated successfully
```

## Database Changes

New records created:
- `QuestionItem` - Each of the 10 questions with archetype metadata
- `EvaluatorResult` - Each answer's evaluation with XP and score
- `ChatMessage.classifier_token` - Intent classification result

## Rolling Back (If Needed)

If you need to revert to the old flow, I can restore the original views. Just let me know!
