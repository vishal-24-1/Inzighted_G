# RAG Answer Fix - Tanglish Summarization Issue

## Problem
When users asked questions classified as `RETURN_QUESTION` (e.g., "what is Q-bank?"), the system was:
1. ✅ Correctly classifying the intent as RETURN_QUESTION
2. ✅ Calling `_answer_user_question_with_rag()` to retrieve the answer
3. ✅ Getting relevant content from RAG/Pinecone
4. ❌ **But then the Tanglish summarization was turning the answer into a question back to the user!**

### Example Issue
User asked: "what is Q-bank?"

Expected response: "Q-bank is a question bank system that contains..."

Actual response (buggy): "Q-bank na enna nu theriyalaya? Ungalukku therinja varaikum sollunga." (Translation: "Don't you know what Q-bank is? Tell me what you know.")

## Root Cause
In `backend/api/agent_flow.py`, the `_answer_user_question_with_rag()` method had a weak summarization prompt:

```python
# OLD (BUGGY) CODE:
summary_prompt = f"Summarize this in Tanglish (short sentences <20 words each):\n\n{rag_response}\n\nSummary:"
```

The LLM was interpreting "summarize" ambiguously and sometimes generating a question/prompt instead of providing the actual answer.

## Solution

### Fixed Code
Updated the Tanglish summarization prompt to be explicit and directive:

```python
# NEW (FIXED) CODE:
summary_prompt = (
    f"Convert this answer into concise Tanglish style (mix of Tamil and English). "
    f"Keep the key information but make it conversational and brief (under 150 words). "
    f"IMPORTANT: You must PROVIDE the answer, not ask the user a question.\n\n"
    f"Original answer:\n{rag_response}\n\n"
    f"Tanglish version (provide the answer):"
)
```

### Additional Improvements

1. **Added RAG response validation:**
   ```python
   if "I could not find" in rag_response or "I don't know" in rag_response:
       return f"{rag_response}\n\nLet me know if you have other questions..."
   ```

2. **Enhanced logging for debugging:**
   ```python
   logger.info(f"[RAG] Raw response length: {len(rag_response)} chars, preview: {rag_response[:100]}...")
   logger.info(f"[RAG] Response too long ({len(rag_response)} chars), summarizing in Tanglish...")
   logger.info(f"[RAG] Tanglish summary: {rag_response[:100]}...")
   ```

3. **Simplified return logic:**
   - Always append encouragement: "Now, let's continue with the question."
   - Removed duplicate return statement

## Testing

After this fix:
1. Restart Django server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Test with question: "what is Q-bank?"
3. Expected behavior:
   - Intent: RETURN_QUESTION ✅
   - RAG retrieves answer from documents ✅
   - Answer is summarized in Tanglish style (providing info, not asking) ✅
   - User sees the actual answer ✅
   - System moves to next question ✅
